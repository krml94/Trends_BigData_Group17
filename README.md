Abstract: 
These days, it is very common for an organization to depend on predictive models to solve a few of their business challenges. Among all of those predictions, forecasting time-series data is one of the most important parts. However, building predictive models, tuning those models and improving model performance is complicated and time-consuming. In this project we will introduce a time-saving, high-efficiency and user-friendly tool that is used to predict time-series dataset : Amazon Forecast. We will use a dataset that meets both volume and velocity aspects of big data to introduce this tool, this compared with the performance of models built by ourselves potentially on a subset of this same dataset. We will then show the comparative advantages of this tool.
